## Hey! All

Welcome to **CLIFF TECHNOLOGIES** – A new way of tracking Your Jumps.
We build smart, AI-powered tools that help athletes **track**, **analyze**, and **elevate** their tricks – from the snowpark to the streets.


### 🧠 What We’re About
CLIFF is developing a mobile-first, real-time performance tracking ecosystem designed for freestyle sports like skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, and more.  
Using smartphones, smartwatches, and lightweight wearables, we capture motion and transform it into 3D trick visualization, AI feedback, and topography-aware stats.


### 🤝 Contributing
We’re building something cool and we’re just getting started.

👾 Coming Soon:
